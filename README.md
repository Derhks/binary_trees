- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree



# What is a binary tree?

A binary tree is a data structure in the form of a tree, each node of the tree has a maximum of two children, left child and right child, these children are branches of the tree root and the parent nodes. 

- The root node is the node that does not have a parent.

- The binary tree to be full all its nodes must have its two children or none, so that this complete one must have each one of its complete levels with the exception of the last one.

- The binary tree, in order to be perfect, all the interior nodes have two children and the leaves have the same level of depth.

- For the binary tree to be balanced, the difference in height of the left and right sub-trees must not be greater than one.

- Finally, it is considered a degenerated binary tree that each parent node has only one child.
